# Background and Research Question

Violent crimes remain a public safety concern in the United States. As
defined by the FBI violent crimes involve used of force including but
not limited to murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault [@FBI2019].
Nationally violent crimes are on the rise with notable increase in
aggravated assaults and homicides [@FBI2021]. Urban areas experience
higher rates of violent crimes than rural areas. Los Angeles in
particular has consistently reported above average rates of violent
crimes, with incidents being concentrated in specific neighborhoods and
often linked to specific seasons or time periods [@lee2024].

Prior research indicates that these patterns are unevenly distributed
across the city and persist over time citing recurring hot spots,
seasonal trends, socioeconomic conditions, and neighborhood dynamics
[@lee2024; @rosenfeld2023] as major contributors to crime variations.
Further studies emphasize the importance of spatial and temporal data in
improving predictive accuracy [@Balocchi2019; @Roses2021].

This study aims to identify the factors that most strongly influence and
predict violent crime across Los Angeles using spatial, temporal and
socioeconomic data.

## Sub-Question 1

Are certain neighborhoods or times of day linked to higher rates of
violent crimes?

Exploring these patterns can reveal areas where preventative measures or
community resources may be most effective. By mapping crimes across
different districts and examining trends by hour, day, or season, we can
identify recurring patterns that can further our understanding of when
and where violent crimes are most likely to occur
[@lee2024; @Roses2021]. This can help guide policing efforts and
resource use to make neighborhoods safer.

## Sub-Question 2

Which machine learning models most effectively predicts the likelihood
of a violent vs. non-violent crime based on time, location, and other
key features?

By comparing models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and
Naive Bayes, we aim to evaluate how well different algorithms capture
the relationships between these variables [@Roses2021].

# Preliminary Data

The dataset [@LACrime2020] we are using includes crime incident reports
from the City of Los Angeles, starting in 2020 and updated as of October
18, 2025. It includes information such as when and where each crime
happened, the type of offense, and details about the location. There are
also fields for victim characteristics, weapons used, and case outcomes.
This data helps us look at crime patterns over time and across different
areas in Los Angeles.

# Preliminary Methods

We will conduct our analysis in Python using Jupyter Notebook to explore
and model crime data reported by the LAPD from 2020 to the present
[@Balocchi2019; @Roses2021]. Using pandas, geopandas, and visualization
tools, we will examine how patterns in crime vary by time of day,
neighborhood, and demographic factors [@Balocchi2019; @lee2024]. Mapping
the data will show which areas and times have higher rates of violence
[@Roses2021]. Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression,
Random Forest, and Naive Bayes will then be applied to classify these
incidents as violent or non-violent [@Roses2021]. Model performance will
be assessed through metrics like accuracy, recall, and ROC analysis to
determine predictive accuracy.
